# 🚑 Low-Cost Intelligent Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Device  
**An Affordable, Smart, and Mechatronic Life-Saving Marvel**  

## 📜 Project Overview  
**Cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of sudden fatalities worldwide.**  
With manual chest compressions being **exhausting, inconsistent, and error-prone**, this project presents an **intelligent, low-cost, and efficient Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) device** designed to enhance **blood flow augmentation** and **hemodynamic stability**.  

This **dual-mechanism CPR device** integrates:  
✅ **Cardiac Pump** – Generating blood flow via sternal compression  
✅ **Thoracic Pump** – Enhancing circulation through intrathoracic pressure modulation  
✅ **Closed-Loop Feedback System** – Adaptive compression rates based on age group  
✅ **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)** – Real-time control and monitoring  

This project aligns with the **American Heart Association (AHA) CPR Guidelines** and has been optimized for use across **children, adults, and senior citizens**.
